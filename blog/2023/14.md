我们示例中的博客文章将作为本地降价文件存储在我们应用程序的目录中（不是从外部数据源获取），因此我们需要从文件系统中读取数据。

在本节中，我们将完成创建一个从文件系统读取降价数据的博客的步骤。

## 创建 .md 文件

首先，在项目根目录创建一个 `posts` 文件夹，在这个文件里创建两个 `.md` 文件。两个名为 `first.md` 、 `about.md` 的文件。

现在，将以下代码复制到 `posts/first.md` 文件里：

FanMa is a developer who doesn't know JavaScript language, and recently he developed a blog platform using Next.js 13. This platform not only has a beautiful design, but also is very user-friendly.

Next.js 13 is a promising framework that takes React applications to new heights. It provides some useful features, eliminates many common troubles, and produces applications with higher performance and better user experience.

FanMa's blog platform is a good example, and many features of Next.js 13 are applied in this platform.

Firstly, the performance of this platform is excellent. Next.js 13 provides a very fast development environment, allowing developers to create high-performance applications in a short time.

Secondly, this platform is extremely user-friendly. FanMa spent a lot of time designing the interface when developing this platform to ensure that users can use the platform easily and naturally.

Finally, this platform is scalable. FanMa has implemented some very intelligent features to improve the scalability of the platform. For example, he uses some artificial intelligence algorithms to predict with neural networks, so as to automatically generate the best matching tags and improve the searchability of articles.

Overall, FanMa's blog platform is a great example that showcases some of the real advantages of Next.js 13. This platform has excellent performance, is easy to use, and has scalability and many other useful features. We hope to see more developers using Next.js 13 in their applications.
